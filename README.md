# SUMMARY AND BIO
Hi, this is me, Andr√© (or you call call me Andrew or whatever) and I'm currently studying Software Engineering at UEPG and I'm a mobile developer intern at Madatech. In my internship, I use mostly TypeScript and ReactNative, but I also love Angular and Vue (you know, for their simplicity. React is amazing and extremely efficient and robust, but sometimes things get really hard to understand, because it has some weird and complex ways of doing things. I still love it so much, nevertheless).
Besides coding, I also enjoy studying new languages (or even trying to "engineer" my own), writing and creating stuff (i.e. fictional words, random projects to publish on Github, etc.)
